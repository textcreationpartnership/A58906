            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> in his first Epistle to the Church of God at <hi>Corinth</hi> chap. 11. reproves the Men for wearing Long Hair, and the Women for wearing their Hair uncovered.

                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>iveth Reasons. First, <hi>The Man is not of the Woman, but the Woman of the Man.</hi> 2dly, <hi>Neither was the Man created for the Woman, but the Woman for the Man,</hi> v. 8, 9. <hi>For this cause ought the Woman to have power on her Head, v.</hi> 10. (as the Translators have observed) that is, a Covering, in sign that she is under the power of her Husband. Which Covering before her Fall was only her Hair, as <hi>v.</hi> 15. <hi>for her Hair was given her for a Covering.</hi> And hereupon the Apostle observing the order of God's Creation, from thence groundeth his Reproof; first, to the Men of the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> (and to all Christians in them) saying, <hi>Doth not even Nature it self teach you, that if a Man have long Hair it is a shame to him,</hi> v. 14. and the Scripture teacheth us, <hi>Sin is the cause of shame,</hi> Exod. 32.25. Rev. 3.18. Ezek. 16.52. And as there is no Sin but in breach of God's Order, so this was a sinful shame in Man to violate Gods holy Order in Nature in wearing Long Hair, the sign appointed by his Creator of his Wifes subjection to him. And because the Womans Long Hair was the sign of her subjection, therefore it is called her <hi>Glory,</hi> as the word Glory is used in <hi>Exod.</hi> 8.9. <hi>Moses</hi> said unto <hi>Pharaoh, Glory over me,</hi> or have this Honour over me in appointing me the time when I shall pray for thee. So that as Man was created in subjection to his Creator, therefore called the Glory of God: the Woman created in subjection to the Man, therefore called the Glory of the Man; <hi>Nevertheless</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>neither is the Man without the Woman, neither is the Woman without the Man in the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.11.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:55784:2"/>
            <p>Moreover, As the Man and his Wife were naked, and were not ashamed until they had sinned by breaking God's plain Law, and so brought shame on themselves and all their posterity, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. &amp; 7.14, 17. therefore accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the wisdom of God, the Man and his Wife must be cloathed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.21. But as the Woman which was ordained by the Lord for an help meet for her Husband, became an instrument of his Fall, therefore she brought a shame on her Glory, to wit, on her <hi>Hair,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.15. and hereupon the Apostle teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that not only the Womans Body must be covered, but also her Hair, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.6. <hi>For if the Woman be not covered, let her also be shorn;</hi> and again, <hi>if it be a shame for a Woman to be shaven or shorn, let her be covered:</hi> which word, <hi>also be shorn,</hi> respecteth the Man whose Hair ought to be shorn, or short: for here the Apostle sets the Man and Womans Hair, for length, in opposition the one to the other, that the Man's Hair ought to be so short that for length it cannot be made to serve for the use God gave Woman's long Hair for, to wit, to cover her Face, which now since the Fall must be tied up and covered as with a vail, by which her subjection to her Husband is still signified, as <hi>Abimelech</hi> an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then King, who was not so ignorant of God's order in Nature (as is to be fear'd too many Professors are) who in reproving <hi>Sarai,</hi> told her that <hi>her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band was to her a covering of the eyes,</hi> Gen. 20.16. (or <hi>vail</hi>) as the former Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation renders it: whose words are confirmed by <hi>Rebeka</hi>'s practice, she having given her consent to have <hi>Isaac</hi> for her Husband, and in her journey he coming to meet her, the Servant having told her it was his Master, therefore she took a Vail (mind that) and covered her self, to wit (as aforesaid) her face and eyes, because the Face represents the whole person, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.6, 5. &amp; 16.6, 8. <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.32. <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.16. And again, the Apostle giveth another weighty Reason why the Woman must be covered, especially in the Church-Assembly, <hi>because of the Angels,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.10. who are many ten thousands of them about the Throne of God there, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.22. and we are a Spectacle to those glorious Guardians of our Salvation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.13, 14. who have a charge from the Lord to keep his People in all their ways, <hi>Psal.</hi> 91.11. encamping about them that fear the Lord, and delivereth them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 34.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>der, either in his Worship or Nature, the Lord will forsake them, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.39. and so his Angels charge towards them ceaseth.

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55784:2"/> with a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.4. and their Bodies also adorned with the sign of subjection to their own Husbands, with shamefacedness and sobriety, and not with broidered or plait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Hair, or frisled Foretops uncovered to their shame, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.6. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.9. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.3. following the steps of such dishonest Women the Prophet speaks of, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.3. the sign of whose immodesty was seen on their foreheads, which by another Prophet is compared to the attire of an Harlot, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7.10. And will not civil Women blush for shame, when they behold themselves in a Glass thus attired, especially if they reckon themselves Christians, or Women professing Godliness with Good-works, and leave off this undecent guise of <hi>Frisled Hair,</hi> or after any other manner laying out their Hair to be seen, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring what is written, <hi>Judg in your selves whether it is comely for a Woman to pray unto God uncovered</hi> (who in so doing) <hi>dishonoureth her head, and it is even all one as if she were shaven,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.5, 13.</p>
            <p>So that it becomes not modest Women to have their Hair uncovered; but if they regard not the habit of civility, and will go with their Hair uncovered, by their so doing they declare to all that see them, that they are of the number or rank of such Women who are under their Husbands charge for dishonesty, according to <hi>Numb.</hi> 5.18. where we reade that the Woman which was under the trial of Jealousy, The Priest uncovered the Womans Head, (as one of our ancient Brethren, Mr. <hi>H. Ainsworth</hi> in his Annotations on that place observeth out of an Hebrew Record, That one of the Priests uncovered the Womans Hair, and untied the Locks of her Head to make her unseemly: And as he further observeth in his Annotations, That the covering on the Womans Head was a sign of her<note n="†" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.5, 6, 7, 10.</note> subjection to the Man; so the uncovering of her Head might be a sign that now she was in her own power to clear or condemn her self.) And forasmuch as God is a God of Order, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.40. and punisheth the breakers thereof, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.13. which caused the Prophet to desire the Lord to order his steps in his Word, <hi>Ps.</hi> 119.133. and therefore that all unseemliness in Men and Womens Habits might be avoided, the Lord hath expresly commanded that the Woman shall not wear that which pertaineth to Man, neither shall a Man put on a Woman's Garment; for all that do so, are an abomination to the Lord, <hi>Deut.</hi> 25.5. so that (as aforesaid) Long Hair by God's appointment pertains to Women, and Short Hair to Men: but if Man will not regard the Law and Order of his Creator, but violate the same in wearing a womanish Hair, the sign of his Wifes subjection to him, by so doing he despiseth the Command of God, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.13. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.14. <hi>Deut.</hi> 25.5. (before whose Tribunal-seat all shall shortly appear to give an account of every vain thought, idle word, and wicked action, <hi>Gen</hi> 6.5. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.20. <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.36. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.12.) and testify against himself that he is not the Womans Head, but that they are equal in power; because the sign ordained by the Lord of his Wises subjection to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55784:3"/> him is on his Head, to wit, Long Hair, and for this cause bringeth himself un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the reproof of that which is written; <hi>Man that is in honour, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth not, is like the beasts that perish,</hi> Psal. 49.20.</p>
            <p>Yet some peradventure for all this will object, for the love they have to wear Long Hair, which is so highly esteemed in this vain Age, and say, <hi>What's that you call Long Hair forbidden men to wear, that is a shame to Nature?</hi>

And about that time a long Lock on the left side the Head was all the Mode in <hi>England.</hi> But as English people stay not long in one Fashion, so they quickly changed that, and wore their Hair long all round the Head, so that in short time they that wore short Hair were despised and called <hi>Roundheads,</hi> and many such Revilings: Which mockings began to be burdensom to Professors to bear, and he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from this shame of Long Hair made himself a prey, <hi>Isa.</hi> 59.15. that at length Professors were not any longer willing to deny themselves, and take up Christ's Cross and follow him, though Christ called to them, saying, <hi>Whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever doth not bear his Cross, and follow me, cannot be my Disciple,</hi> Luk. 14.27. And <hi>Moses</hi> knew the Reproaches for Christ's sake were to be esteemed of far greater value than the Treasures of this World, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. which caused the Saints in all Ages to account all the Glory and Honour of this World but dung, that they might win Christ. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8.</p>

And because Long Hair is a shame to Nature, and a breach of the second Table of God's Law, therfore King <hi>Henry</hi> the first of this Nation commanded Mens Long-Hair to be cut off, as our Judges and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices formerly used to do oft-times at Assizes, being against God and Natures Law. See Mr. <hi>Prynn</hi>'s Book aforesaid, p. 11. And hereupon we can but admire
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55784:3"/> at the confidence of some Professors (never before heard of in any Age) who wear a Womanish length of Hair, and glory in it, yet boast so much of the Light in them, when as they want the Light of Nature, much more of Grace, which if they had but either, it would teach them that it is a shame for a Man to wear Long Hair; surely the Light in such is Darkness, <hi>Job</hi> 10.22. And if <hi>the Light</hi> (to wit, of Nature) <hi>that is in thee</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>be Darkness, how great is that Darkness?</hi> Mat. 6.23. because Men understand not earthly or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural things, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.12. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.14.</p>
            <p>Other Professors there are under divers titles, which we omit to name, that are under the practice of Ordinances, who increase their number by receiving such as fit members of their Societies, that have not yet learned the first princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Religion, as Repentance from dead works, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1.

And <hi>Josephus</hi> in the <hi>Wars of the Jews,</hi> book 15. chap. 14. saith, <hi>The Temple when the Sun shone upon it did cast such a light as dazled the eyes of the beholders:</hi> How ought then the Spiritual Temple of lively stones to shine? see <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Isa.</hi> 54.11, 12, 13.</p>
            <p>Answerable hereunto was the building of the Spiritual Church or Temple of Christ, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. under the Gospel, which is bu lt by measure, to wit, the Golden Reed of God's written Word, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.1. &amp; 21.15. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 40.3.</p>

            <p>Moreover, If in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple Porters were appointed that no unclean or defiled person might enter therein, because the dwelling of the Lord was there, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7.2, 12. &amp; 23.19. how much more ought every true Church, which is the habitation of God (<hi>Eph.</hi> 2.22.) to watch, that none unclean with the shame of Nature, or other pollution, enter there, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.27. because Holiness becomes the House of the Lord. Therefore the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> that returned from <hi>Babylon</hi> to the Lord's House, might not eat of the Passover until they se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated themselves from the filthiness of the Heathen of the Land, <hi>Ezra</hi> 6.21. and entered into Covenant to walk in the Law of the Lord, <hi>Ezr.</hi> 10.29. how much more ought Christians, who have said they are come out of the Spiritual <hi>Babylon,</hi> the false Church, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.4. to separate themselves from all unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which is so rise there, and in such high esteem, to wit, Long Hair, seeing it is written to the <hi>Israel</hi> of God, <hi>Levit.</hi> 18.3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.16. <hi>After the doings of the Land of</hi> Egypt <hi>wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not do: and after the doings of the Land of</hi> Canaan <hi>whither I bring you shall ye not do; neither shall ye walk in their Ordinances. Ye shall do my Judgments, and keep my Ordinances, I am the Lord.</hi> But Professors instead of obeying the Lord in forsaking the vain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation of the shame of Nature, that if their own Long Hair please them not, they can wear Perriwigs made of Womens Hair; were ever the like Professors heard of since the days of <hi>Adam?</hi> These cannot be of the number of the wise Virgins, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. who if ever they had any Oyl in their Lamps, have spent it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.20. for from the Oyl of G d's Grace they never learned to habit themselves in this Monster-like guise, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.7, 8. which wandring Stars can never give any true light to poor souls, <hi>Jude</hi> 13. How can such Preachers that adorn their Heads with the Hair or Excrements of Women, possess their Vessels in sanctification and honour, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 4.4. Yea, how can such call God Father, when they fulfil the works of the flesh, and so of the Devil, <hi>John</hi> 8 <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.19. yea, how can any one believe that such Preachers doctrine can be under any blessing of God to their Hearers? but we may believe the contrary, as saith the Lord, <hi>They shall not profit the people,</hi> Jer. 23.32.</p>
            <p>Because the Priests under the Law might not have on their heads the shame
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55784:4"/> of Nature, but were commanded by the Lord not to suffer their Locks to grow long, but to poll their heads, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44.20. how much more ought the Ministers of Christ's glorious Gospel to be without long Hair, the shame of Nature, and so therein be blameless, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2. But if the Eye, or Minister, in a Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be tainted with this evil, will not the Body be full of Darkness? and, as the Prophet saith, <hi>The Leaders of</hi> such <hi>People cause them to err; and they that are led by them, are destroyed,</hi> Isa. 9.16. For the Watchman especially ought to give the People warning, and warn the Wicked from his way, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.7, 8. as it is written, <hi>Thou shalt not hate thy Brother in thy heart: thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him;</hi> Lev. 19.17. Mat. 18. And if God's Order herein be neglected, sin will soon reign, as it doth in this shame of Nature amongst almost all sorts of Professors. But the end draweth nigh, Christ's Word must be fulfilled, that <hi>iniquity shall abound, and the love of many shall wax cold;</hi> Mat. 24.12. as saith the Prophet, <hi>Your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear,</hi> Isa. 59.2. What then will it avail Professors that have not owned Christ as their Prophet, to be guided by his Laws, and their King, to submit and do according to his Will therein. If they boast, and say to Christ when he cometh to Judgment, <hi>Lord, Lord, we have prophesied in thy Name, and in thy Name have cast out Devils, and in thy Name have done many won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous works:</hi> Christ's Answer is, <hi>I never knew you, depart from me ye workers of iniquity,</hi> Mat. 7.22, 27. What need had all then to remember that he that shall keep the whole Law, and yet offend in one point, is guilty of all, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.10. Then happy is that man that condemns not himself in that thing which he alloweth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.22.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now then, if Professors through ignorance have accustomed themselves to be like others to disobey the Lord, who saith, <hi>Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil,</hi> Exod. 23.2. in wearing the shame of Nature, <hi>Long Hair,</hi> and not considered the danger in offending God, according to this small discovery concerning the same, let such know God will not be mocked by any who have presumed to violate the Order of their Creator, <hi>For whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap,</hi> Gal. 6.7, 8.
